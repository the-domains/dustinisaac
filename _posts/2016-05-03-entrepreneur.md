Are you an entrepreneur? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8060b5ed-bc6e-4645-b504-9addb8b05d3e.jpg)

I've always known I was an entrepreneur, but I didn't think it was called that. Honestly I thought there was something wrong with me. I wanted to try and do everything, but I was in a world that told me I needed to do one thing for the rest of my life. 

THAT WAS NOT ME

How would I ever change it? I have so much passion and ambition, but I was always trying to fit that in a box of doing one thing for the rest of my life. 

I knew I wanted to take the leap and start my own business, but how would I do it? How did other people do it? How did they get started? 

JUST DO

Not it, _just do. _You have to start somewhere and if you get fixated on what it is, you'll never start. I started an online merchant business, without even knowing the first thing about what I was doing. I didn't make any money, and even lost some, but man was it fun. From that point on I was hooked, I knew I could do this. 

The amazing thing about being an entrepreneur or starting a business, is that you get to all the things! Yes, I want to _do all the things_. You're not just going to be an IT guy, or an accountant, or graphic designer. You get to do all of those things and then some. 

So you want to be an entrepreneur, you want to start a business, but don't know where to begin. Well, what are you interested in? Do you like technology, puppies, knitting? It doesn't matter. Just jump right in and do!

I realized that no one knew what they were doing when they started, but they did start. Even if you went to school for something specific, you still have to start somewhere.

I went to a speed dating thing one time with a friend. It was billed as the largest speed dating event ever. I was skeptical to say the least, and wasn't really interested in dating, but I went along for the ride. The event was a catastrophe, nothing was organized, no one knew what was going on or where. I've never been to a more poorly organized event, but while I was passing all sorts of judgement on the organizers, I saw the man behind it all. He was just a regular dude, that had an idea, and was running all over trying to salvage this mess. 

It was in that moment that I realized I could do anything, all I had to do was _**do**_. The event turned out alright, but I got way more than a date out of this. I found myself, I found out it's ok to fail. I found out it's ok if you don't know what you're doing. 

If you're an entrepreneur like me, then likely you've felt the same way before. But I'm here to tell you not to be afraid. You can do it, you will fail, you will fall, but it will be glorious. Along the way, you just might change the world and have fun doing it. You'll look back on your life and it will be rich with all the wonderful things you've done. 

Cheers to you, and cheers to your new life!
